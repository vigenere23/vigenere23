### Hi folks! 🤙

I'm a senior year student in Software Engineering (B.Eng) and starting my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (M.Sc.)!

- :heart: I love doing what I do! Solving problems, learning new tools and methods every day and always improving myself!
- 🔭 I’m currently working at [Kimoby](https://kimoby.com), learning at [ULaval](https://ulaval.ca) and improving my frontend, devops and design skills with all my personal projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about software architecture and agile development!
- 🏆 I'm quite at ease with UI design, Vue, Typescript, and Web development and architecture
- 🌟 I'm always improving my [portfolio](https://vigenere23.github.io), stay tuned!
