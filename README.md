### Hi folks! 🤙

I'm a senior year student in Software Engineering (B.Eng) and starting my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (M.Sc.)!

- :heart: I love doing what I do! Solving problems, learning new tools and methods every day and always improving myself!
- 🔭 I’m currently working at [Kimoby](https://kimoby.com), learning at [ULaval](https://ulaval.ca) and improving my frontend, devops and design skills with all my personal projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about software architecture and agile development!
- 🏆 I'm quite at ease with UI design, Vue, Typescript, and Web development and architecture

#### Latest work

Lately, I've been working on an ecosystem of libraries for the Front-End development under my brand name, **gab.io**. Those include :

- [@gabio/design-svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gabio/design-svelte) : A Svelte design library by me, for everyone!
- [@gabio/design-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gabio/design-vue) : The Vue (and initial) version of the design library
- [@gabio/markdown-transpiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gabio/markdown-transpiler) : An extensible Typescript markdown transpiler

Lots of documentation :book: will come at some point
