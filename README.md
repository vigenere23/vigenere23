## Hi folks! 🤙

### Now doing

- Coding a craaaazy multiprocess data acquisition pipeline for finger angles predictions from EMGs 😮

- Drinking good coffee at 3 PM on a sunny terrace ☕

### 🏆 What I do

- User-oriented Web UIs that are fully responsive, inclusive and carefully designed
- Domain-Driven architectures based on flexible, extensible and reusable modules
- Small librairies to make my life easier (like [@gabio/markdown-transpiler](https://github.com/vigenere23/gabio-markdown-transpiler))

### ❤️ What I love

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

- Machine learning, deep learning and NLP
- Learning, teaching and creating!
